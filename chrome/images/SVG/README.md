These are the icons used for the compose.svg image.

The first 'send.svg' was opened in inkscape and the page expanded to 16h x 90w
Then each other icon was imported and positioned (appended) to the right of other images.
A rather simple process, or at least the only one I could contrive at the time.

Again, since these images are referenced in css by position within the compose.svg image,
they must be left that way or you will have to change the source code (css).
